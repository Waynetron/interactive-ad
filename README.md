# Interactive ad concept

Interactive ad concept using scroll input.
Designed for mobile, specifically the portrait aspect and scrolling with a finger.

Ideally test it on device. But it does work fairly nicely in Chrome when emulating a mobile device (in Developer Tools) and dragging up and down with the mouse.
